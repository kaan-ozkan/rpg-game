# rpg-game
Text based RPG game as a project for my second year university course, made with my group mate, Mehmet Efe Zorlutuna.

This project was made using Visual Studio for C++ and requires _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to be placed under the preprocessor commands as there are certain unsafe functions used.
